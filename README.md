# SIMD
Data Science Project - Edinburgh overview for International Students.
We collect data from SIMD (Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation) and focus on City of Edinburgh area.

**A Guide to International Students to Stay Safe, Live Rich, Be Qualified**

**By Feni Fauziah (S2450308), Yingxuan Li (S2599248),  Nadira Amelia (S2478626), Sarah Albinali (S2306999)**

**Assigned dataset: The Scottish Index Multivariate Deprivation (SIMD)**

**Purpose**
We want to create an accessible guide for international students to help them prepare for their studies in Edinburgh from safety, living cost, to getting a job, from a data-driven perspective. 

**Intended Audience**
Our intended audience are International students who want to study at The University of Edinburgh, particularly prospective postgraduates.

**Design Reflection**
We chose storytelling because our goal is to present users with information that is likely to be of interest to them. By reading a story, users can linearly absorb information instead of reading raw data. We present the data comics with a scrollytelling vibe in the form of a website, mainly because of its accessibility. When an international student is searching for information about Edinburgh, they are likely to be in their home country, making physical materials unsuitable for this project. The website, offering more control and interactivity than a video, allows data comics to make serious knowledge interesting and captivate user interest.


**Website Content**
Address Safety Concerns (Stay Safe)
To assist them in choosing where to live and understanding how to protect themselves. 
Living Cost and Budgeting (Live Rich)
We provided information on the cost of living and economic situations in Edinburgh, so they could prepare in advance. 
Job Opportunities as a Foreigner (Be Qualified)
Foreignerâ€™s interest in the UK job market has doubled since post-Brexit, we outlined the challenges international students face in finding jobs in the UK, emphasized the importance of having a degree, and provided some helpful links.

**Website Technologies**
The website is created using HTML, Javascript, and CSS. The charts were created with Flourish that are embedded to the website. The data is extracted from open source datasets, the news, and other external sources, mainly from:
The Scottish Index Multivariate Deprivation from 2016 and 2020, which covers the 7 indicators of deprivation in Scotland.
The Office for National Statistics for data on the UK's economy and on the census of international students who stayed in the UK after graduation.
Scottish Government, to gather data on crime.

**Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work**
During the creation of the guide, with the high amounts of information we had to process, it was a challenge to figure out which important data that we needed to form a compelling story while keeping it readable at a glance. In the end, there was a lot of interesting data that was cut off from the main story to keep the narrative coherent. In the future, we would like the website to be an all in one informational guide for international students.
